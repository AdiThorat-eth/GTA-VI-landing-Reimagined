GTA 6 Web Application 🏎️💥
About
GTA 6 is the most anticipated open-world title, so I developed a stunning, responsive web application dedicated to the game. Having played the GTA franchise since my childhood, I am a massive fan of the series, which inspired me to build this project. Developed with modern web technologies, it focuses on delivering a high-performance and immersive interface for the GTA community. 🎮🔥

Why This Project? 🌟
As a lifelong fan who grew up exploring every corner of Liberty City, San Andreas, and Los Santos, creating this application was a passion project. It is designed to reflect the high quality and detail that Rockstar Games is known for. This project is my tribute to the franchise that defined my gaming journey.
